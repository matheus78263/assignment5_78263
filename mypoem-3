Let me not to the marrige of true minds
Admit impedments; love is not love
Which alters when italteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark,
t is the ster to every wand'ring bark,
That looks on tempsts and is never shaken;
Whose worth's unknows, although his heitgh be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rose lips and cheeks 
Whithin his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not wit his brief hours and weeks,
Buts bears it out to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
